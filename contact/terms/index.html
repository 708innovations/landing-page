                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>We literally copied and pastied the first terms of service template that we could find on
                                the internet. But in essence, it boils down to:</p>
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> We don't do illegal things, and we don't let
                                    you do illegal things.</li>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> This is our website, so we can kick you off or
                                    decide not to service you if we don't want to.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Overall, it should be pretty simple, hopefully you understand, but if not, you can find
                                the full text below anyways. If you find an issue with these terms, please let us know ASAP.
                            </p>

                                any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all

                            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability
                                for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations
                                may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
                                extent permitted by law.</p>

                                limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
                                enforceable under applicable law.</p>
